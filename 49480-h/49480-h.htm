<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Breakfast-room of the suburban villa of Mr. Twitters. The
mother of the late Mrs. Twitters and Mary Jane are discovered.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> But I tell you this is Mr. Twitters’ breakfast, mum. There’s
no telling what he’ll do if he don’t catch the train this morning. He’s
ordered the horse ready since seven o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>breaking an egg</i>). In the midst of life we are in death. I have
left my humble lodgings this morning to attend the interment of the
remains of our late pastor, the Rev. Dr. Elijah Paddy&mdash;&mdash;a hot muffin,
Mary Jane!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> What will master say, mum? There won’t be no breakfast left.
He has the alarm-clock set in his hat-bath to wake him at seven, and it
made such a noise, mum, that he flung it out the window and went to
sleep again. And<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a> he’s been rampaging round and ordering breakfast on
the table for the last hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> The carriage will serve me in my sad errand. I have a floral
tribute in this box to place upon the grave of the dear departed,&mdash;&mdash;a
little more hot toast, Mary Jane,&mdash;&mdash;an anchor, expressive of hope and
Christian resignation. It will be but a trifle among the many offerings.
The Rev. Mr. Paddy never knew how many friends he had until he was dead
(<i>breaking another egg</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> You’re eating the last egg, mum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I grieve that there is no other egg, but this will suffice to
support me through the trying ceremony. He was an eminent Christian,&mdash;he
had three wives. (<i>Bell rings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>without, calling</i>). Has that thundering shoemaker sent my new
boots?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span> (<i>calling at door</i>). Just come, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Cease this unseemly noise, girl (<i>rising</i>), summon the equipage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> The equipage, mum? I didn’t see you come in no carriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> My limited earthly resources do not permit me to provide myself
with such luxuries. I shall use one of your master’s. My poor, dear,
departed daughter, did not survive to enjoy his prosperity. I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> But he wants the carriage to go to the train, mum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Trains go hourly. (<i>Takes up a box. Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span> (<i>standing at window</i>). Well, if the late Mrs. Twitters was
like this mother of hers, it ain’t no wonder that master’s kind of
fidgety like. There,&mdash;she’s got hold of John, now, and she’s stepping
into the carriage that was going to take master to the train. And she’s
druv off! Oh, deary me. What vicious things elderly women can be.
(<i>Enter Twitters hastily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>Looking at watch</i>). I shall have a close shave for the 9-20
train, but I think I can manage it. Breakfast’s ready of course, of
course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> It <i>was</i> ready sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>approaching table</i>). Why, what on earth does this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> The mother of the late Mrs. Twitters&mdash;<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The devil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> No, sir, the mother of&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Is she here? (<i>With feeling.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> No, sir, she’s gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Something ghoulish is going on somewhere, then, or she would
have stayed. That women is a perfect vulture. If anything horrible
happens to anybody, she comes pouncing down to gloat over it. I’m
becoming a fiend, myself; I rejoice in the news of any misfortune, for
it means temporary deliverance for me from her&mdash;has she eaten
everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> All there was, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> How soon can you get some more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> It’ll be ten minutes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I shall have to breakfast in town, then. I must be off. John’s
here, of course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> No, sir, he’s took.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Good heavens! A fit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> No, sir; the mother of the late Mrs. Twitters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Where has she taken him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> To the funeral obelisk of an Irish gentleman, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> To Parson Paddy’s funeral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> That’s just it, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I hated that man, but his death caused me deep sorrow. Her cap
was set at him. I must run for the train. Where are my boots? Ah, here!
(<i>Opening a box and producing a funeral wreath</i>) what in the name of
nature is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> It’s her’s, sir; she’s been and gone and took the boots to
the burying, and she’s left nothing behind but Christian resignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Damn Christian resignation. (<i>Pitches box across stage; a
letter falls out; he picks it up and opens it during speech.</i>) Call Miss
Clara and tell her I’ll breakfast with her. I can’t get to town till
eleven, now. And get something uncommonly good to eat, mind you. A bad
temper needs good food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Yes, sir; I noticed, sir, how the old lady had a fine
appetite.<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>severely</i>). Speak civilly of members of my family, if you
expect to keep your place. (<i>Glancing at paper, which he has taken from
envelope.</i>) Why, the damned old harridan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>reading</i>). “Theophilus Twitters, Esq., to Grimsby &amp; Weeper,
florists. Funeral orders attended with despatch in the latest and
tastiest styles. To one Christian resignation, roses, immortelles, etc.,
$15. A prompt payment is requested.” Then in pencil: “For the sake of
our departed Sarah you will please meet this little account.” This is
the last straw. I’m a strong camel but my back breaks at this. I’ll give
orders that she shan’t be let into the house. And as for this bill, here
goes (<i>goes to table and writes</i>): “Grimsby &amp; Weeper; sirs: I won’t pay
this rascally, swindling bill, or any other. T. Twitters.” (<i>Rings bell,
then sealing letter.</i>) That will settle Christian resignation, I reckon.
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>standing in door with handful of letters, timidly</i>). Mr.
T-Twitters&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>not looking up</i>). Come here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>approaching timidly</i>). Yes, Mr. T-Twitters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Take this to the post and look sharp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> But I’ve just come from the post, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> What’s that to me? (<i>Looking up.</i>) Dear me, Charles, I thought
you were my man. Seen the paper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I’ve brought it in, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>seizing it</i>). How’s Harshaw this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Why, I never thought of looking, sir. If it had occurred to me
that you’d have liked to know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> 38 7-8! Three per cent. rise! I’m six thousand in pocket!
(<i>With a sigh.</i>) You’re a lucky dog, Charles; you don’t tremble whenever
you look at a stock-list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> No, sir; I don’t seem to look at one, often. (<i>Nervous.</i>)
You’re surprised to see me at this hour, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Hadn’t been&mdash;but now you mention it, I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> You see, I happened in at the post-office, and I saw your mail,
and I thought that you might like to have me leave it at your house on
my way home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>laughing</i>). You’re a sly dog, Charles. What time do I go to
town?<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Why, 9-20 I ’spose, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>pointing to watch</i>). At this moment it’s 9-25, you young
rascal, and you have the impudence to say that you came to see me.
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Did you ring, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes. Take this letter to the post, and look sharp (<i>handing
letter which he has written</i>); and, I say, tell Miss Clara that there’s
a gentleman here that wants to see her. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Here are your letters, Mr. Twitters. I assure you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I like your little game, Charles, I like it. Perhaps Clara’ll
like it, too, you young Machiavelli. Now don’t pretend you didn’t come
to see her. Six thousand in, by Jove. I must sell out Harshaw as soon as
I get to town. Bottom’s sure to fall out of it. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>with
watering pot</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Good morning, papa dear, (<i>kisses him.</i>) Why, Dr. Squillcox, are
you here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> As if you didn’t expect him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> How can you say such things, papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes, Mr. Twitters, it’s most unjust&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> If I had expected anybody, should I have brought in this great,
heavy watering-pot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Can’t I hold it Miss Clara? (<i>takes it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I was going to water my flowers in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Go along, my dear: and go along with her, you rascal.
(<i>Laughs. Exeunt</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>laughing</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>rubbing his hands</i>). There they go. It does my heart good to
think that my little Clara has such a good fellow to look after her; and
that I can act as the ways and means committee. I’ll take care that
their love shan’t fly out of the window. (<i>Opens letter.</i>) Here’s the
plumber’s bill. Old Faucet will be rolling in his carriage soon. If
Charles gets tired of medicine I’ll set him up as a plumber. (<i>Opens
another letter.</i>) Clara’s milliner’s bill. Egad! how Charles’ eyes would
open, if they tried love in a cottage on his professional outcome.
Hollo! What’s this? Shabby looking letter addressed in a shabby hand.
Another bill, I suppose. No. What’s this? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Theophilus
Twitters,<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a> Bloated Bond-holder. I am a foe to capital and the
Grand-master of a secret society organized to cripple said capital, to
muzzle monopolists, and to elevate the horny-handed son of toil.” You
have a good-sized contract, my friend. “When the copartnership of
Tollgate &amp; Twitters engaged in their corner in sugar, and robbed the
poor of the luxuries of a free breakfast-table, our society determined
to foil you. As their agent, I secretly entered the warehouse in which
your hoard of sugar was stored, and secreted in various spots amidst the
innocent condiment no less than twelve pounds of arsenic. After having
done this, I notified your partner, the aforesaid diabolical Tollgate,
of my action, and apprised him that all the sugar must be
destroyed,&mdash;else poison would be thrown broadcast upon the world. You,
as his partner, are affected with notice of this. (As a foe to capital,
I have incidentally been trained as a lawyer.) The aforesaid diabolical
Tollgate, with your connivance,”&mdash;Damn law words. I hate ’em&mdash;“With your
connivance sold the sugar. Through secret channels the deadly grains of
arsenic are distilled into the veins of society. The blushing damsel,
receiving taffy from her lover, curls up and dies. The fond mother,
pouring out her children’s cambric tea, gives them the black wine of
death. Candy-shops are charnel-houses! Society gatherings are volcanos!
Ice-cream leads to the grave! And all through you, most miserable of
mortals, who lie soft and count your ill-gotten wealth.” (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary
Jane</span> <i>with coffee. He starts to drink</i>.) “But even you are not exempt
from the insidious enemy. The very cup of coffee that you may now be
raising to your lips may call you to judgment.” (<i>Drops coffee cup.</i>)
What sinful nonsense. I shouldn’t give it a thought if it didn’t charge
my poor dead partner with such villany. And Tollgate was a Sunday-school
superintendent. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span> <i>with breakfast</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> The letter’s mailed, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Letter? What do you know about the letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Sure, you gave it to me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> No such thing. Ah, to be sure! How absurd to be so
discomposed. So breakfast’s ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane</span> (<i>arranging table</i>). Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>after a short pause, during which he has<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a> fidgeted</i>). By the
way, Mary Jane, you haven’t happened to hear much illness about of late.
Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Why, sir, there has been folks go off sudden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> You don’t say so? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Well, sir; there was poor Mr. Tollgate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Apoplexy&mdash;apoplexy, beyond all doubt. Caused by the success of
our corner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Then, sir, there was my grandmother, only last week, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes, I remember. But I’ve remarked that that melancholy event
has happened twenty-seven times in the course of the year. I infer that
your grandfather was a Mormon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Which I consider that remark most unfeeling, sir. And what
with waiting on the mother of the late Mrs. Twitters, sir, and getting
two breakfasts for you, and having my own grandfather abused, sir, I
cannot submit to it, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Leave the room, girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Jane.</span> Which I shall take pleasure in leaving, sir, this day week,
sir. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>playing with breakfast things</i>). All right. It’s absurd to
think of this matter. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred an anonymous
letter is a lie, but if this should turn out to be the hundredth I
should be a Borgia. Heavens. What a situation. Why, even my poor
daughter would be blighted. I could never permit her to marry and to
perpetuate a crime-stained race. I wonder what the effect of arsenic is.
Happy thought. I’ll look it up in my encyclopædia. Glad to put the thing
to some use. (<i>Takes down the volume.</i>) A-r-t&mdash;a-r-s-e-n-i-c. That’s it.
(<i>Reads.</i>) “Arsenic is one of the most violent of the acrid poisons. Its
use in medicine and toxicological properties are treated under medical
jurisprudence.” Damn it. Just my luck. (<i>Looks at bookcase again.</i>) My
set stops at “Lam.” Pooh! Pooh! Why, even if the whole thing were true,
twelve pounds. (<i>Looks at letter.</i>) Yes, he says twelve pounds&mdash;in a
whole warehouse full of sugar wouldn’t do more than improve the
complexion of the public. I should be a benefactor. (<i>Enter Charles and
Clara.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Is breakfast all ready, papa, dear? I’m dreadfully hungry.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Quite ready, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Where shall I put this? It’s very heavy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Heavy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes, you see it is quite full of water. I’m afraid of wetting
the carpet, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Why! Sure enough! We forgot to water the flowers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Forgot it, eh? Young people have queer memories, nowadays. Put
that confounded thing in the hall, Charles. You are a medical man. How
do you account for the curious prevalence of sudden death?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>returning from hall door</i>). Why, I haven’t thought much about
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The newspapers talk about arsenic in wall papers. Nonsense,
don’t you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>soaring to professional fluency</i>). Not a bit of it. Arsenic is
the most deadly of drugs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Oh, you don’t say so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> What a disagreeable subject! Come to breakfast, papa dear. (<i>At
table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Stop, Clara, we are not ready for food; I am interested in
this matter. How deadly is arsenic&mdash;how much would kill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Well, in wall-papers it’s one thing; in the stomach, it is
another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Take stomachs. I’m interested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It’s only common prudence to have your wall-paper tested
(<i>looking at paper</i>); I don’t like that green.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Confound it, sir; I’m talking about stomachs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Papa dear, aren’t you ready?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Don’t interrupt us. Charles&mdash;how much arsenic will kill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> A deadly dose for an adult is five grains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> How do you weigh it? How many grains to the pound?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Twenty grains make a scruple&mdash;there are three scruples in a
dram&mdash;that’s sixty grains&mdash;in an ounce there are eight drams&mdash;that makes
four hundred and eighty&mdash;and in a pound there are twelve ounces&mdash;twelve
times four hundred and eighty are five thousand seven hundred and
sixty.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Then a pound will kill&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Five into five once&mdash;into seven, once and two over&mdash;into
twenty-six, five times and one over&mdash;and into ten twice. A pound would
kill about eleven hundred and fifty-two able-bodied men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>to himself</i>). Twelve times eleven hundred and&mdash;good heavens.
(<i>Sinks into chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles is going to breakfast with us, papa dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Charles! What do you mean by speaking of Dr. Squillcox by his
Christian name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Why&mdash;<i>you</i> do, papa dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes; but I’m not a marriageable young woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>to Charles</i>). You had better speak, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Mr. Twitters&mdash;the fact is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Yes, papa; the fact is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The fact is, young man, that you have come here before
cock-crow, pretending to bring the mail to me&mdash;gauzy pretext&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I assure you, Mr. Twitters, I did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> By no means, papa dear. He came to see me; and he is going to ask
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I see what he’s at. I consider your behavior surreptitious,
sir. What have you to recommend you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> He has my love, papa dear. That’s all <i>you</i> have but a little
money. Now be a dear, good, sweet papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Sweet! Oh&mdash;42,000 grains&mdash;I have your love, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Why, yes, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Very good. I don’t choose to share it. Your conduct is little
better than robbery, sir. You ought to blush redder than the bottles
that conceal the poverty of your stock in trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> My calling is respectable, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Then follow its example in your conduct, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I shall, sir. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Charles, are you going away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> And naturally, sir, you won’t expect to return?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Naturally not, sir. (<i>Exit.</i>)<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>aside</i>). There he goes; worthy young fellow. But while this
arsenic is hanging over my head there must be no thought of love or
marriage in this fated home. Clara, dear, don’t let this trouble you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> O, papa, I don’t know which of you troubles me most. You are so
harsh and Charles was so&mdash;so&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Pusillanimous, Clara. A single rebuff was enough for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>crying</i>). O, dear! O, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>patting her shoulder</i>). There, dear, there! Remember, as long
as I live you have some one to love you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> But it isn’t the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> No, the honest love of a father is lasting&mdash;come to breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>going to table sobbing</i>). T-two lumps in your coffee, papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>with emphasis</i>). Great Heavens! No! (<i>Recovering himself.</i>)
That has been my usual dose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Dose! (<i>Sobbing again.</i>) O dear! Poor Charles!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>aside</i>). A deadly dose for an adult is five grains&mdash;twelve
times eleven hundred and fifty-two&mdash;enough to kill twenty-five thousand
women and children. The board of water commissioners are a choir of
white-robed angels beside my partner if this is true. Why will you put
so much sugar in your coffee, dear? You make it a perfect liqueur!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I always had a sweet tooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> A sweet tooth leads through a heap of dentist’s bills to a set
of false ones. I can’t have you eating these horrid sweet things,
candies, sweet-meats, ices, and jams. Your dentist’s bills ruin&mdash;(<i>he
has pulled her coffee cup towards him, and put salt into it</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> What are you doing with my coffee, papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Putting salt in it; it’s not coffee that hurts you, it’s the
mixture of coffee and sugar. I read somewhere that coffee and sugar
together make leather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> No, papa; tea and milk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Coffee and sugar! (<i>Aside.</i>) Of course the letter’s a hoax. It
doesn’t disconcert me. But to think of my partner having a monument
detailing his Christian virtues! He always passed the contribution box,
and, now I think of<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a> it, he used to have a great deal of loose change of
a Monday. Read me the paper, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don’t like reading aloud. The newspapers are so full of
politics and murders and business and accidents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I regard the daily paper as a necessary part of every young
girl’s education. Here it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>reading</i>). “Double hanging in Atlanta! Pernicious poisoning. A
diabolical crime.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>starting</i>). Eh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>reading</i>). “A man poisoned by lemonade administered by his wife.
The post-mortem reveals distinct traces of arsenic in the stomach.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Clara! Where was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> O, in Kalamazoo, or some such horrid western place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Kalamazoo! Great heavens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> How can a horrid man in Kalamazoo concern us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> In no way my dear. (<i>Aside.</i>) I must dissemble&mdash;go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>reading</i>). “The unfortunate couple were well known in the
highest social circles. The married life of the twain had been unmarred
by a cloud. It seems most strange that a train of circumstantial
evidence is wound around the unhappy wife, which points”&mdash;(<i>stops</i>).
Papa, dear, how can a chain point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Continue your reading, flippant girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>reading</i>). “Which points at her as the murderess. It seems that,
with a noteworthy economy, she alone of the household had access to the
sugar barrel.” (<i>Turns and refolds paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>aside</i>). The sugar barrel! In far-off Kalamazoo! That letter
bears the stamp of truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>having folded paper, reads</i>). “The lemonade was prepared with
her own hands. Traces of arsenic were found in the glass from which the
victim drank his last drink; and in the barrel of sugar, which had but
just arrived from the highly respectable store of Spicer &amp; Co., not less
than half an ounce has already been discovered&mdash;” What stupid stuff!
Why, papa! What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>with his head on his hands, in agony</i>). Nothing,<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a> my dear
nothing. It is so terrible to think of all that suffering (<i>Enter
Hunker</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Mr. Twitters, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes, what do you want? (<i>Seizing and pocketing paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Your servant was not disposed to introduce me, so I take the
liberty of introducing myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I’m not well this morning, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>sitting down.</i>) Naturally enough. The morning news doesn’t
agree with you, I presume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>nervous</i>). I don’t understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I have a little business with you&mdash;rather private nature. You
might prefer to have our young friend here leave the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>rising with dignity</i>). I am going, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Good day&mdash;Miss Twitters, I reckon&mdash;pleased to have met you. Hope
to see more of you. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> And now, sir, who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> “A foe to capital, and the grand master of a society organized
to cripple said capital, muzzle monopolists and elevate the horny-handed
son of toil”&mdash;at your service, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Ah, you wrote me a letter this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The writers of anonymous letters are dealt with according to
the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> So are venders of poisoned food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I don’t believe a word of your story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>calmly and deliberately producing papers, which he turns
over</i>). I have proofs that arsenic was in the sugar, that the sugar was
sold by the copartnership of Tollgate &amp; Twitters, that one if not both
of said firm knew of this rather unpleasant adulteration. (<i>Twitters
grabs at papers.</i>) Don’t lose your self-control, Twitters, I never do.
There are copies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Granting your proofs, then,&mdash;supposing the whole thing true,
you, the poisoner, will suffer more than I, the victim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>calmly</i>). I shall turn State’s evidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>sinking back in chair</i>). Good heavens!<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> See here, Twitters. I’m a fair minded man. In practically
maintaining sound economic principles, I’ve concocted a scrape. We’re
both in it. We must back each other up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> What do you want me to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Well, I ain’t comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Neither am I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Naturally; you don’t like the prospect of hanging, and I don’t
like the prospect of continuing to breakfast from early morning
milk-cans, and to bone newspapers to keep me in tobacco. Now, you make
me comfortable and I’ll guarantee you shan’t swing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Well, well, how much do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I aint mean in money matters. Let’s see&mdash;By Jove, Twitters, I
like the looks of this box of yours. I’ll make you a visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I’m not joking, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> No more am I,&mdash;I have proofs; first, that arsenic was in the
sugar; second&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I must yield.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> All right, Twitters. You’re more intelligent than you look.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I have a good back room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I prefer a front one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The front one is mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Sorry to inconvenience you, I’m sure, but I can’t put up with a
back one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>aside</i>). Crimes do come home to roost with a vengeance!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Where is your trunk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Would you believe it, Twitters, I’ve shoved up every thundering
rag that ain’t on my back. I’ll borrow of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> This passes patience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> It’s hard to bear; but your clothes are good, if they aint
handsome. I aint proud. But proud or not, I want a bath. If you’ll
believe it, Twitters, I’ve not bathed since&mdash;but we won’t be unpleasant
and vulgar, will we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> The servant will show you to the bath-room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> You’d better do it yourself, Twitters; I don’t like to lose
sight of you&mdash;not that you’re so awful handsome to look at, but&mdash;you
twig? Thanks, I’ll sample your strong<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a> waters (<i>pouring brandy from
decanter to goblet and drinking</i>). Where’s the bath-room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> This way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> All right. Now you treat me fair, and I’ll treat you fair.
(<i>Smacking his lips.</i>) I’m square. That’s prime tipple. (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>appearing at window</i>). Nobody’s here. I must see Clara! (<i>Door

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Papa! Is that horrid man gone? Papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>appearing again</i>). Hush!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>starting and turning</i>). Oh!&mdash;It’s you, and crawling through the
window. Dr. Squillcox.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> “Dr. Squillcox.” O, Clara&mdash;come here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>approaching window</i>). I hate you. If you had really loved me you
would have shown more courage with papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> It was insane of me to ask a man for his daughter’s hand before
he had eaten his breakfast. (<i>Takes her hand.</i>) But it’s all serene,
little girl. I’ll make it well. (<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> It doesn’t make it well at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I have such an immense plan. You must be taken very ill, this
afternoon. Your father will forget his dyspepsia in worrying over you.
All remedies they give you must fail. Old Dr. Parkinson is away, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>clapping her hands</i>). And papa will have to send for you. At
your first powder&mdash;you mustn’t give me pills&mdash;I can’t take them&mdash;I’ll
get well immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> And your papa, delighted at my skill, will give your hand to
your preserver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> How clever you are, Charles! (<i>Noise without.</i>) Go away.
Somebody’s coming. (<i>Charles disappears.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Twitters</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>advancing thoughtfully, aside</i>). I wonder if the brand of
Cain is perceptible upon my brow. To think that I should be the cause of
all this suffering! That no day may pass without a death which proper
investigation<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a> might lay at my door! That all my life must be passed
with this terrible man. I cannot endure it! (<i>Sits down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>approaching him</i>). Why, papa, you look ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Ill! Yes, this is a wicked world, Clara. I meant to strew your
path with roses, to hide from you the villainy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>without, shouting</i>). Towels, Twitters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> O, dear! What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>rising</i>). It is the voice of fate. (<i>Calling.</i>) Coming, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>without</i>). Found ’em! No matter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> A gentleman is come to stay with me, dear; and while he is
here, we shall have so much business together that I have been thinking
that it might be well for you to visit your kind grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> But I don’t want to. Grandma has horrid things to eat. Who is
this gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> You saw him here, this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> That horrid, dirty man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> An old friend of my boyhood, Clara&mdash;a worthy man, whom the
world has dog’s-eared by hard usage. I am superior to prejudice, but I
cannot expect you to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I should hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> So you had better go at once, dear. I’ll send your things. He
is rough, I know, but he has a gentle, kind heart&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>without</i>). I say, Twitters! Where are you? Damn you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>calling</i>). Here, sir. (<i>To Clara.</i>) Go away, dear, quickly.</p>

<p>(<i>Clara goes toward door. As she reaches it, Hunker appears and meets
her, face to face. He is showily dressed in clothes of Twitters’,
somewhat too small</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>bowing</i>). Much obliged, miss; you were coming to show me the
way, I ’spose. I’ve found it, you see. I heard your lovely voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> My daughter was going out, Mr. Hunker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I guess she’d better not. It ain’t a nice day out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I beg your pardon, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Twitters, this young woman mustn’t go out. Do you twig?<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Good-bye, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> You had better stay, dear. (<i>Clara stops, amazed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> So I think. (<i>Drawing long breath.</i>) I feel like a new man, and
I’m going to give the new man a drink. (<i>Pouring out brandy again.</i>)
What’s her name, Twitters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> My daughter is named Clara, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Lovely name. Here’s to Clara (<i>drinking</i>). Sit down; we’ll soon
be pals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Sit down, dear. (<i>Clara sits amazed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Two young people like us can’t be thrown together in a house
without liking each other pretty well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>to Twitters</i>). I cannot submit to this, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>to Clara</i>). We should never take offence when none is meant,
dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I’m an adventurous cuss, Miss Clara&mdash;just on from Arizona to
float a gold mine on the eastern market. Going to let Twitters in at
bed-rock prices&mdash;eh, Twitters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes, yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> We had hard old sledding on the plains, at times, Miss Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Indeed, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Chased by Indians twenty miles, riding with Custer&mdash;you know
Custer? Seventeen of them miles I had a bullet in my leg (<i>starting to
pull up his trouser leg</i>)&mdash;want to see the scar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>with terror</i>). No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>pleased with himself</i>). O, we’re kindred spirits; we’ll soon be
friends. I like your New England country. As Lady Franklin said to me,
when we was taking supper together on the Oregon steamer. She was goin’
to hunt up John’s bones in Sitka, where I kept a hotel&mdash;“Beans is a
benevolent institution, Mr. Hunker,” says she. “You’re right, Lady F.,”
says I. Now speak up, if you’re talked to death, Miss Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I have nothing to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> All right. I can talk right along,&mdash;keep it up forever. By
George, it would be funny if you and I should conclude to keep it up
forever&mdash;eh, Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don’t understand this man, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> He is a rough diamond, dear.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Then he ought to be “cut.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Why, make a match of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>aside</i>). O dear. I shall be ill, really. I must send for
Charles. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Papa, I don’t feel well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>starting</i>). Eh, my dear! What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I have a head-ache.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Have you been eating sugar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>agonized</i>). I fear so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Does your throat burn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>faintly</i>). Yes, yes, I want to lie down (<i>they lead her to
sofa</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> My God! It’s the symptoms&mdash;see what you’ve done!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> I, you miserable man! Behold your work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> No time for fooling, Twitters. I know the antidote. I’ll run to
the nearest apothecary&mdash;it’s too bad, I vow! Here, give me sixty cents.
(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> There you are, my poor child! (<i>Gets towel, which he wets with
cologne and puts to her head.</i>) Does that help you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> O papa. It doesn’t make me any better! Send for the doctor!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Yes, yes. (<i>Aside.</i>) If the doctor should discover poisoning!
If it should be traced to me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>faintly</i>). Dr. Squillcox&mdash;the other one’s away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>without</i>). Where is Twitters? I <i>will</i> see him. (<i>Enter
Mother.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> You are here&mdash;I entered the hushed chamber where all that was
mortal of the sainted Elijah Paddy was lying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Don’t talk of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Overcome by emotion, I averted my head, and blindly removing the
brown paper wrapping, I placed upon the heart of the departed what I
thought to be a floral tribute&mdash;a lovely anchor, expressive of hope and
christian resignation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Can’t you see that poor Clara is ill? Be still, woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Who insults me by calling me woman? I stood with averted face. A
stir of excitement thrilled the<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a> hushed and weeping assembly as my
offering was seen. Touched by this appreciation of my tribute, I turned
to take a last view of all that was earthly of the departed&mdash;there, amid
a heap of roses and camellias lay those odious <i>boots</i>. (<i>Pulling them
from under her cloak, holding them at arm’s length and throwing them
down.</i>) Without a word I fled. I am undone forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Say no more of boots. Look at my suffering child and hold your
peace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I need no word from you to succor my departed Sarah’s child
(<i>walking towards the couch. She snatches at</i> <span class="smcap">Twitters’</span> <i>hand</i>). Your
allopathic doses are killing her (<i>producing phial</i>). These pellets will
cure her (<i>starts to give</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span> <i>pills</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> No sugar pills! For heaven’s sake, no sugar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>severely</i>). These are rendered efficacious by an infinitesimal
reduction of arsenic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>in agony</i>). Give them to me. (<i>Struggling with her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Prejudiced monster. Like cures like. (<i>They struggle for the
phial. Twitters wrenches it away and flings it into the fire-place.
Mother stands panting with rage.</i>)</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter an Officer of the Law.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Theophilus Twitters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>excited</i>). Yes, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I arrest you, in the name of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>agonized</i>). The blow is fallen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>between horror and joy</i>). O that I should have lived to see
this day! (<i>Crossing to</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>.) My poor child, your mother’s mother
will care for you, while your sinful parent expiates his crimes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>aside</i>). Why doesn’t Charles come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>imploring</i>). Officer, a few moments with my suffering child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Couldn’t think of it. Get your hat.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hunker</span>, <i>hastily, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>).<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>recognizing</i> <span class="smcap">Officer</span>, <i>aside</i>). Thunder. There’s a copp.
(<i>Aloud, with tremor.</i>) What’s wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer</span> (<i>sententiously</i>). Twitters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>coming forward</i>). And this man, too&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>imploring</i>). Shut up! I’ll fix things!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> A few weeks ago he came to me and offered me a large sum for
twelve pounds of arsenic&mdash;to kill rats, he said, but&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara</span> (<i>who has risen in her excitement</i>). But, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>trembling with excitement</i>). But what, Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> But that he might not go elsewhere&mdash;for I saw that his end was
crime&mdash;I sold him <i>powdered sugar</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Powdered sugar! A mountain has rolled off my breast! You’re an
angel, Charles!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>enraged</i>). <i>You’re a damned mean apothecary!</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Officer, you don’t want me now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> I don’t see how all this makes any difference in the suit of
Grimsby <i>et al.</i> <i>v.</i> Twitters,&mdash;criminal libel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> Grimsby &amp; Weeper!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Them’s the people. You called them rascally swindlers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> The makers of my tribute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> They didn’t like my letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> That’s so. But you’re a stampy old duffer. This gentleman
(<i>pointing to</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>) will go surety on your bond?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> Good day, gents and ladies (<i>starts to go. To</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>). Now our
match is off, you’ve got well putty quick. Good day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> See here (<i>touching his shoulder</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker.</span> I aint libelled nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Officer.</span> Dry up! Come along with me. I want your phiz in the rogues’
gallery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunker</span> (<i>putting hat on one side</i>). I guess I can screw it up so as you
won’t know it again. I say, Twitters, I’ve made a suit of clothes out of
this, anyhow. (<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Clara</span>). Ah, you sly puss! Charles was the medicine you
needed! Here, Charles, she’s your’s and half my fortune with her. Thank
heaven, I’m not a blear-eyed Borgia, chumming with a prison-bird.<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> I don’t understand you, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters.</span> No reason you should, my dear. Everything is bright and happy,
excepting that I shall lose my little girl and be left all alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> (<i>embracing him</i>). I will take her place, Theophilus. The past
shall be forgotten. I will never desert the lonely husband of my
departed Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twitters</span> (<i>shaking her off. To himself</i>). I shall have to send for
Hunker.</p>
